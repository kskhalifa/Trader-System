## Introduction
This Project was worked on collaboratively over the course of the term, and is designed to be a system that
is able to support defining trading brokers from which each respective broker can declare lists of crypto currency
coins that they would like to be shown the price of, for use with a trading strategy of choice (multiple options available). 
The trading strategy of choice will be executed after retrieving said cryptocoins price data from CoinGeckoâ€™s site,
through the utilization of the CoinGecko API, to notify each broker by displaying the trading log & trading activity (i.e. Table or Histogram).
